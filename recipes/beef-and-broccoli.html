    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup lower-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lower-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups thinly sliced yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages fresh broccoli florets, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked jasmine or sticky rice, or as needed</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Whisk together beef broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, and rice vinegar in a bowl until combined and sugar and cornstarch are dissolved; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add broccoli, and cook, stirring occasionally, until bright green, tender-crisp, and onion is browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Do not wipe skillet clean.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium, and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Add ground beef and salt, and cook, stirring often to break meat into even crumbles, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk broth mixture again, and pour into skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Return broccoli mixture to skillet, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce evenly coats meat and vegetables, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve over rice, and garnish with scallions and toasted sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
